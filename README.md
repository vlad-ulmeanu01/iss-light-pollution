# iss-light-pollution

.py code that ran on the ISS, trying to detect light pollution. A small set of the edited images can be found in the folders.

If you would like to see the code, please message me at vlad.ulmeanu01@gmail.com.

As AstroPi is a competition that takes place every year (even though its format doesn't change), I couldn't, unfortunately, make my source code public, as it could have been used by somebody competing now.
